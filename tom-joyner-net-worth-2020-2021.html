His family is one of those, which wholeheartedly celebrate their black culture and roots.</p><p>His parents were both graduates from institutes which were founded on black traditions. His brother, Albert and he were alumni of Tuskegee Institute, also known as the Tuskegee University, which is highly regarded and historically renowned for having a black tradition.

However, this music venture failed miserably, at least in financial terms. At this point, Tom Joyner’s parents suggested him to tread a different career path, and he did that.
