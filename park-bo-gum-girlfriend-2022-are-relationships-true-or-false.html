However, let’s just have a look at how great their bonds are actually.</span></p><h2>Park Bo-gum’s Dating Rumors With Jang Na-ra</h2><p><span>Both <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Park Bo-gum</a> and Jang Na-ra starred in the 2015 KBS drama I Remembered You. In early 2016, rumors began circulating and even intensified when Park Bo-gum had a ring on while a fan signing for Reply 1988.</span></p><p><span>Back then, Park Bo-gum stated during an interview that “It was surprised to see the dating rumors with Na-ra,” and confirmed that they were not more than just good friends.</span></p><p><span>In February 2016, during an <a href=# rel=noopener>interview session</a>, he also talked about the speculations that were being made about him dating Jang Na-ra.</span></p><p><span>Park Bo-gum said, “I noticed that dating rumors with Jang Nara were spreading. It made it look like I was dating her. I felt awkward having to call her after that. I was surprised since it’s such a nonsensical rumor.”</span></p><p><span>“It felt new since this is my first scandal, but I also felt sorry towards Na-ra noona. Perhaps it started when we filmed I Remember You together,” he further added.</span></p><p><span>When he was questioned about how he feels about having to cope with such rumors, he responded, “It’s an inevitable thing since I am a public figure. I’m actually trying to be thankful for the attention. I will be more careful and cautious in the future.”</span></p><p><span>After a year, the dating rumor intensified into a wedding rumor regarding Park Bo-gum and Jang Na-ra, as the actors were seen together on Cheongdam Wedding Street.</span></p><p><span>Fans expected that the duo would be busy with wedding preparations. Park Bo-gum and Jang Nara’s agencies retorted on June 23, 2017, “It doesn’t make any sense. We don’t know why these kinds of rumors are being spread without even evidence,” and emphasized, “The reports are false.”</span></p><h2>Park Bo-gum’s Dating Rumors With Kim Yoo-Jung</h2><p><span>There were also rumors about Park Bo-gum having a close relationship with actress and model <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Kim Yoo-Jung</a>. The duo was seen together in the 2016 drama Moonlight Drawn by Clouds.</span></p><p><span>Ever since the drama premiered, rumors started circulating over the Internet that the duo was in a relationship. It has been reported that Park Bo-gum has always been “very nice” to Kim Yoo-Jung, and the close interaction between them was misunderstood as a romantic bond.</span></p><p><span>However, Kim revealed that she sees him just like a sibling.
