He later moved on to the theatre department, simply because he perceived the theatre students to be having all the fun.</p><p class=Fg>Richmond later moved to Chicago, and shortly after, he landed his first paying gig playing the piano at Del Close's ImprovOlympic Theater. Here the talented composer met his future wife, Tina Fey, along with fellow comedic actress Amy Poehler.</p><p class=Fg>Apart from his job as head of the music department at "SNL," he was also responsible for the music of Fey's "30 Rock," Michael McCullers, "Baby Mama," "Mean Girls," and "Maya & Marty."</p><p class=Fg>Tina Fey and her husband have displayed unusual chemistry over the years, which has given rise to some remarkable television and film productions.
