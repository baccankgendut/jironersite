The Banshees of Inisherin won four BAFTAs and Elvis took home four BAFTAs.&nbsp;</p><p id=esNEBzII336D data-wc=27>The film's main star&nbsp;Austin, who starred as Elvis Presley, won the award for best Leading Actor while Leading Actress was won by Cate Blanchett for Tár.</p><h3>In Memoriam</h3><p id=enFRnVtA583_ data-wc=64>A touching In Memoriam clip also played, paying tribute to late stars Anne Heche, William Hurt, Olivia Newton-John and Robbie Coltrane. Towards the end of the tribute, a fitting clip of <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Harry Potter star Robbie</a></strong> in his role as Rubeus Hagrid was shown to the audience. The camera then <a class=hm-link href=#>panned to his co-star Emma Thompson</a>, who was sat with her husband Greg Wise, as she looked visibly moved and applauded the heartbreaking tribute.</p><h3>The Prince and Princess of Wales</h3><p id=eE3EK34XBynY data-wc=82><a class=hm-link href=#>Prince William and Princess Kate made quite the entrance</a> on the red carpet at the 2023 BAFTAs. William, 40, looked smart in a black velvet tuxedo while Kate looked stunning in a reworked Alexander McQueen one-shoulder gown and statement black arm gloves. She also chose statement earrings from high street favourite, Zara. Prince William has been the president of Bafta since 2010, and Kate first attended the event with her husband in 2017. She started a tradition for wearing British designers on the Bafta red carpet, choosing a black McQueen gown.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2cb341e36646-prince-william-kate-2023-baftas-z.jpg><p id=eeshrJKHsWKo data-wc=7><strong>Prince William and Princess Kate looked incredible</strong></p><p id=egkeMed_scfa data-wc=66>During one emotional moment, <a class=hm-link href=#>the Prince looked visibly emotional</a> as <a class=hm-link href=#>Dame Helen Mirren</a> paid a special tribute to his late grandmother Queen Elizabeth II. As an image of the monarch flashed up on screen, Dame Helen said:<strong> "Your Majesty, you were our nation's leading star.</strong>" The actress, 77, has portrayed the monarch on the silver screen and on the stage, winning an Oscar and Bafta for her depiction in 2006's biographical drama The Queen.</p><h3>Wrong winner announced</h3><p id=er5kCJyL2ECJ data-wc=85>Although the BBC decided to edit this part, CODA actor Troy Kotsur appeared on stage to present the award for Best Supporting Actress but <a class=hm-link href=#>mistakenly announced Carey Mulligan's name</a>&nbsp;before&nbsp;it was confirmed Kerry Condon was the actual winner. Carey was nominated in the category for her role as Meghan Twohey in the film She Said while Kerry was nominated for her part as Siobhán Súilleabháin in The Banshees of Inisherin. It's not clear how the mix-up occurred but Kerry then swiftly took to the stage to accept her award.</p><p id=ezyChro0qdLb data-wc=35>Accepting the award, Kerry said: <strong>"Thank you Martin (McDonagh) for this part, and thank you for all the parts you gave me throughout my career. You make me so proud to be an Irish woman."</strong></p><h3>New BAFTA hosts</h3><p id=erMWGG6gw7L2 data-wc=78>Actor Richard E Grant hosted the 76th annual film awards ceremony at the Royal Festival Hall while <a class=hm-link href=#>This Morning</a> presenter Alison was at the helm the Bafta Studio, an immersive and access-all-areas experience, as part of the BBC One show. During his opening speech,&nbsp;BAFTA presenter <a class=hm-link href=#>Richard made a dig at Will Smith's Oscars slap</a>. The Withnail and I actor, who hosted the awards, took to the stage to welcome guests to the ceremony when he made a joke about the jaw-dropping moment which took place last March.</p><h2>BAFTA 2023 complete winners list:</h2><h3>Best Film</h3><p id=eOUZNDk1o2_m data-wc=15><strong>All Quiet on the Western Front -
