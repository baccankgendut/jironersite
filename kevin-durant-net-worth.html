Kevin Durant is one of the highest paid players on and off the court. His $42 million NBA salary makes him one of the five highest-paid players in the league. His multiple lucrative endorsement deals allow him to earn tens of millions more each year.</p><p>Between June 2019 and June 2020, Kevin earned $65 million from his various endeavors. After spending three seasons with the Golden State Warriors, in 2019 Kevin signed a four-year $164 million contract with the Brooklyn Nets.

The other two players are Michael Jordan and <a href=#>LeBron James</a>.</p><h2 id=early-life-career-beginnings><strong>Early Life and Career Beginnings</strong></h2><p>Kevin Wayne Durant was born in Washington, DC, on September 29, 1988. When he was still an infant, his father deserted the family, and his parents eventually divorced. As a result, Durant's grandmother helped to raise him. He has a sister, Brianna, and two brothers, Tony and Rayvonne. They grew up in <a href=# title="Prince George Net Worth">Prince George</a>'s County, Maryland, on the outskirts of Washington, DC. Durant's father returned to his life when he was 13, and together they spent time traveling the country to basketball tournaments.</p><p>Durant played in Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) basketball for several teams in the Maryland area growing up and was teammates with fellow future NBA players <a href=# title="Michael Beasley Net Worth">Michael Beasley</a>, Greivis Vasquez, and <a href=# title="Ty Lawson Net Worth">Ty Lawson</a>. In honor of his original AAU coach Charles Craig, who was murdered at the age of 35, Durant began wearing the #35 jersey number. He played high school basketball at National Christian Academy, Oak Hill Academy, and Montrose Christian School. A highly sought-after recruit, regarded as the second-best high school prospect of 2006, he committed to the University of Texas before his senior year of high school. At the end of his senior year, Durant was named the Washington Post All-Met Basketball Player of the Year, and the Most Valuable Player of the 2006 McDonald's All-American Game.</p><p>Durant enjoyed a successful college career playing for the Texas Longhorns at the University of Texas at Austin. For the 2006-07 college season, he averaged 25.8 points, 11.1 rebounds, and 1.3 assists per game. He was recognized as the unanimous national player of the year and won the John R.

During the 2013-14 season, he surpassed <a href=#>Michael Jordan's</a> record for consecutive games scoring 25 points or more, with 41 games. He was also voted the NBA Most Valuable Player that year, with averages of 32 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 5.5 assists per game. Through the 2015 season, Durant had earned over $88 million in salary alone.</p><p>He left the Oklahoma City Thunder in 2016, officially signing a two-year, $54.3 million contract with the Golden State Warriors that July. He re-signed with the Warriors in July 2018 on another two-year contract, this time for a reported $61.5 million. Then, in July 2019, he signed with the Brooklyn Nets in a sign-and-trade deal.</p><p>In addition to his NBA career, Durant has played for Team USA, helping the team win its first FIBA World Championship since 1994 at the 2010 championship.
