She studied ballet for 13 years, participated in many beauty pageants, and won many titles before she was awarded the state title of Maid of California. Her image as a beautiful woman was already building up, but she wanted to act and, thus, studied theatre at the San Diego State College.</p><p>She worked here and there as a model, actress, and even as a cocktail waitress. Later in 1963, she moved to Los Angeles, where she met Hollywood Agent Patrick Curtis, who became her manager, and she started applying for various roles. She was starred in many small roles in films and television before her famous photo for Life! The magazine came out and changed her career forever.</p><h2>Personal Life</h2><p>Raquel Welch has been married and divorced four times.
