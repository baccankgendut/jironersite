While pregnant, she began to produce antibodies that attacked the baby’s blood and led to his heart rate slowing down.</p><p>The couple were warned that signs of fluid on their baby’s spine meant he could be born with a severe disability.</p><p>Cameron’s condition worsened and he had to be delivered at 34 weeks.</p><p>He weighed 7lb 7oz due to a build-up of fluid but his weight dropped to 5lbs.</p><p>Cameron was later diagnosed with dyspraxia.</p><p>He said: “In the early days before treatment, I would really struggle with catching a ball.</p><p>“My dad used to take me to the local park to kick a ball around but I would miss completely if I tried to kick it and wouldn’t be able to catch it.”</p><p>Staff at Dollar Academy, where he was a pupil, realised there was a problem and he was referred for tests. Cameron was diagnosed with dyspraxia at the age of seven.</p><p>He was given special exercises and had to use audio equipment to improve problems with his hearing.</p><p>He said: “The position I play in American football involves passing the ball to the quarterback and you’ve got to listen to their instructions while there are other noises around.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12623259.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/SN_AMERICAN_FOOTI_13JPG.jpg><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><p>“Without the sort of treatment I had, that would be completely impossible.”</p><p>The family moved to England when Cameron was about 11 – and he feels most of the problems had been corrected by then.</p><p>“It’s never going to be as good as it could have been had I been born at full-term – but it’s certainly corrected a huge percentage and made a massive difference,” he said.</p><p>“It’s quite something when I think about it. Apparently, I used to fall over and walk into things and had problems with listening skills.</p><p>“It was only after the treatment that I became better at doing things like throwing and catching a ball and it became more of an interest to me.</p><p>“But even at secondary school, I still felt I was a bit behind everyone else. I started playing rugby about 11 or 12 and then carried that through school.”</p><p>When he started studying<br>business at Southampton University, Cameron decided to try American football. He fell in love with the sport and his size and strength helped him perform well.</p><p>Cameron was spotted and offered the contract to play in America.</p><p>He said: “There are only three or four UK-born NFL players at the moment and I think every single one had been to school in the States.</p><p>“It’s unheard of to come from a school in the UK. I believe only one other person has done it. I think I’m the first Scottish person to do it.”</p><p>He kept the news he’d landed a contract in America a secret from his family so he could tell them face to face at Christmas at home in Kent.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12623261.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/FMF_SDR_24052018CAMERON2JPG.jpg><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><p>He played them a recording of the Skype call when he was offered the deal and showed them the contract.</p><p>“My parents’ reaction was quite emotional,” he said.</p><p>Scott, 53, who is managing director of Drakes plumbing and heating business, said: “Cameron looked like such a fragile little dot in that incubator with all the wires and tubes hooked up to him.</p><p>“When you think he’s the size<br>and character he is now, it’s like chalk and cheese.</p><p>“In the early days when the health visitor would come round and throw a soft ball for him to try to catch, his hands would miss each other.</p><p>“Now you watch him doing one-handed catches on an American football field.</p><p>“Being so premature, he was so small and vulnerable and now he’s got great timing and coordination.
