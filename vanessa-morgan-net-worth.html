Tired of us also being used as sidekick non dimensional characters to our white leads. Or only used in the ads for diversity but not actually in the show</strong>."</p><p>She also revealed that on "Riverdale," she's "<strong>the only black series regular but also paid the least.</strong>"</p><p>The show's creator, Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, responded:</p><p>"<strong>We hear Vanessa. We love Vanessa. She's right. We're sorry and we make the same promise to you that we did to her. We will do better to honor her and the character she plays. As well as all of our actors and characters of color.</strong>"</p><p>As a result, Vanessa Morgan's per episode salary was reportedly boosted from $20,000 to $40,000. That works out to around $880,000 per season.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Vanessa Morgan was born Vanessa Morgan Mziray on March 23, 1992, in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. She grew up with a Scottish mother and Tanzanian father, and she has a sister, Celina. In 2013, Vanessa and Celina competed on "The Amazing Race Canada" and finished in third place. Morgan started singing at just 6 years old, performing at telethons and community events, and in 1999, she received a scholarship to an acting school in Hollywood after being discovered by a Hollywood agent. That year Vanessa won the Junior Miss America pageant and was named the top vocalist at the National Date Festival in Indio, California. The following year, she won the African-American Vocal Competition in Palm Springs, California. During her youth, Vanessa also participated in the Ottawa Athletic Club's NTA tennis program. She attended Colonel By Secondary School in Ottawa, graduating in 2010, then enrolled at Queen's University to study philosophy.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>Vanessa Morgan made her acting debut in 2000 when she played the young version of Vanessa L. Williams' Ebony Scrooge in the VH1 film "A Diva's Christmas Carol." She was a series regular of the Canadian teen sitcom "The Latest Buzz" from 2007 to 2010, and she performed the show's theme song as well.

Morgan's Toni Topaz spent her high school years as a member of the Southside Serpents, leader of the Pretty Poisons, and bartender at the Whyte Wyrm. Vanessa received death threats from fans who thought Toni (who is bisexual) would cause problems for Betty and Jughead (aka "Bughead"), but she has said she feels honored to play a character like Toni, stating:</p><p>"<strong>It's one of those things where it's scary but I'm so happy. A lot of people judge bisexuality as 'being promiscuous' or something like that. But I believe you can love somebody, you can fall in love with a person's soul.</strong>"</p><p>Morgan has shown off her singing abilities in several "Riverdale" episodes, including "Chapter Fifty: American Dreams" and "Chapter Fifty-One: Big Fun."

Morgan's pregnancy was written into the fifth season of "Riverdale," which took place after a seven-year time jump.</p><h2 id=awards-nominations><strong>Awards and Nominations</strong></h2><p>Morgan has been nominated for three Teen Choice Awards for "Riverdale," winning Choice: Scene Stealer and Choice TV: Breakout Star in 2018; Vanessa and co-star <a href=# title="Madelaine Petsch Net Worth">Madelaine Petsch</a> were nominated for Choice Ship in 2019.
