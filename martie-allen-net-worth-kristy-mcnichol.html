Is Martie Allen married?</p><h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2><p>When people haven’t heard the latest news about their favorite personalities, they become curious about what happened to them.</p><p>Some sadly pass away, some continue to do what they do best, while others simply move on and drop out of the spotlight.</p><p>Some personalities only manage to achieve the spotlight because of their relationships.</p><p>Martie Allen is one such personality whose life people would love to know more about.</p><p>So, let’s find out what happened to Martie Allen and what she might be doing now.</p><h2><strong>The Origin&nbsp; Story</strong></h2><p>Like many celebrities, Martie Allen was thrust into the spotlight due to her relationship with a celebrity.</p><p>In this case, said celebrity is none other than retired comedian, singer, and actress Christina (Kristy) McNichol.</p><p>Martie Allen was born on 1st January 1960 in the United States, and that’s pretty much all we know about her early life before she became famous.</p><p>Allen is very private and does not even have a public social media presence.</p><p>Allen likes to keep her professional life under wraps, but we know she attempted to break into the film industry but could not make headway due to unknown circumstances.</p><p>This is in stark contrast to her partner McNichols, who made significant contributions to the entertainment industry throughout her career.</p><h2><strong>Martie Allen and Kristy McNichol’s relationship</strong></h2><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-51042 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Martie-Allen-Kristy-McNichol-relationship.jpg.webp alt width=800 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Martie-Allen-Kristy-McNichol-relationship.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-1 data-svg=1 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-51042 class=wp-caption-text>Kristy McNichol – @Getty</p><p>Martie and Kristy first became serious about their relationship in 1991, after they had likely been dating on and off for a few years.</p><p>The pair shared a photo of themselves together with People Magazine, and it wasn’t long before the entertainment industry was abuzz with the news. Still, they were together for quite some time before announcing their relationship in 2012.</p><p>The loving couple has reportedly stated that their successful long-term relationship is due to them being themselves and accepting each other as they are.</p><p>Kristy McNichol is a famous personality who retired from acting due to mental health issues.</p><p>Before that fateful day, though, she was a prolific actor who started very young and managed to have a decades-long career before leaving show business for good in 2001.</p><p>Kristy and Allen were inspired to come out because they were concerned about homophobic bullying, which had grown to endemic proportions in the States.</p><p>As she approached the golden age of 50, she and Allen decided it was time to be open about who they were. In 2010 and onwards, suicides among gay and lesbian teens had spiked to unprecedented levels, so the pair thought their openness would bring some hope to troubled young people.</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Laura G Net Worth</a></p><h2><strong>The love of Martie Allen’s life – Kristy McNichol</strong></h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-51043 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Martie-Allen-spouse-of-Kristy-McNichol.jpg.webp alt width=800 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Martie-Allen-spouse-of-Kristy-McNichol.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-2 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-51043 class=wp-caption-text>Kristy McNichol – @Getty</p><p>The love of Martie Allen’s life, Kristy McNichol, was born on 11 September 1962 in Los Angeles, California.</p><p>Her father, James McNichol, was a carpenter.</p><p>Her mother was Carolyn McNichol, and she has a brother named James (Jimmy) McNichol.</p><p>We don’t know much about Kristy’s Mom,&nbsp; but Kristy’s father left soon after Jimmy was born, and her mother raised her kids on her own while working several different jobs.</p><p>Jimmy is a star in his own right.</p><p>Along with being a teen heartthrob and starring in numerous television and movie roles, he is also a co-partner of Playground Television, an entertainment production company.</p><p>Kristy started her career through guest appearances in shows like Starsky and Hutch, The Bionic Woman, Love, American Style, and the Love Boat. However, her roles in movies like Little Darlings really secured her career.</p><p>Parts in shows like Empty Nest and Family soon followed, and Kristy would go on to become a household name. She continued working in the film and television industry until announcing her retirement in 2001.</p><p>Before meeting Martie Allen, Kristy was in several lesbian and heterosexual relationships, including a short fling with Elisabeth Brooks in 1980.</p><p>She has dated singer and songwriter Leif Garret for about a year and a few other Hollywood heartthrobs, such as Scott Baio and Jeb Stuart Adams.</p><p>Kristy seems to have been quite busy dating many high-profile men before settling down with Martie Allen because there are also rumors she dabbled with Liberace, Christopher Daggett, and Joey Corsaro.</p><p>Kristy announced her early retirement from acting in 2001, nine years after being diagnosed with bipolar disorder.</p><p>She briefly popped out of retirement to perform in the comedic take on New York May Bloomberg’s soda ban called Call to Action to Mayor Bloomberg: Sodas and Soap Operas.</p><p>Of course, Kristy is now in a happy and contented relationship with Martie and has been since 1992 at least.</p><p>During their retirement, Kristy and Marty have largely kept out of the spotlight while supporting various charities dealing with mental health issues.</p><p>They are also known to enjoy a spot of traveling and doing yoga.</p><h2><strong>Martie Allen – Net Worth</strong></h2><p>So, how much is Martie Allen worth?</p><p>Martie Allen has an estimated net worth of $1 million.</p><p><strong>READ THIS NEXT:</strong> <a href=#>Who is Liz Shanahan</a>?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaK8tr%2FPnqappJWpvKWt2GeaqKVfoq6zwMieZJqknJq7brrErWSwp6KptW630aKqrbFdorCvtcKhpqVn</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmartie-allen-net-worth-kristy-mcnichol.html&text=Martie%20Allen%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Kristy%20McNichol&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmartie-allen-net-worth-kristy-mcnichol.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmartie-allen-net-worth-kristy-mcnichol.html&title=Martie%20Allen%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Kristy%20McNichol" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmartie-allen-net-worth-kristy-mcnichol.html&title=Martie%20Allen%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Kristy%20McNichol" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmartie-allen-net-worth-kristy-mcnichol.html&title=Martie%20Allen%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Kristy%20McNichol" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmartie-allen-net-worth-kristy-mcnichol.html&description=Martie%20Allen%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Kristy%20McNichol" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./mel-gibson-now-demanding-a-dna-test-on-oksanas-baby.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mel Gibson now demanding a DNA test on Oksanas baby">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./lumidee-cedeno-net-worth-income-salary-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lumidee Cedeo Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
