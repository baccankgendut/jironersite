You cannot begin to judge the sequel without the prequel, which tells the story of Bruno, the nine-year-old son of a nameless commandant of Auschwitz. Bruno is kindly: he is impervious to Nazism, and he calls the Führer the Fury. He loves exploring – his favourite book is Treasure Island – and, walking the fence between his home and the extermination camp, he meets a Jewish boy called Shmuel who is interned in Auschwitz, which Bruno calls “Out-With”. When Shmuel’s father disappears – he is dead, of course – Bruno offers to help him search. He climbs under the fence, borrows a striped uniform – his hair has already been shaved, due to lice – and is gassed alongside his friend.</p><p>If the point is that this could happen to anyone, it is very obliquely made. There are serious objections to The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas. A child like Bruno would know what Nazism is, and would be schooled to hate Jews. A child like Shmuel would not be at liberty to walk the fence, and his anger is so muted it is nonexistent. He is not yet dead, and already he is silenced.</p><p>If you read the hidden testimony of real boys who died in the Warsaw Ghetto, you will hear voices better placed to speak than Boyne’s. When I read the pages in the museum in Warsaw, I heard their terror and fury so clearly, I had to sit down. You will instead, reading The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas, feel terror as Bruno – the boy Boyne makes you love – is incrementally edged towards a fate that Shmuel accepts as his destiny, and there is something immoral about that insinuation: the Holocaust as fate. But it is a skilful novel on its own very&nbsp;narrow terms, if you know nothing about the Holocaust, and&nbsp;if you wish to know nothing, and that is the danger of All the Broken Places too. The emphasis: what is not said, and who does not say it.</p><p>Making art about the Holocaust is morally fraught, as the artist has an obligation both to memorialise and to teach. That is what the subject demands, if you want to be seemly. If you want to be unseemly, please yourself. If you really want to know about boys in Auschwitz, there are two memoirs: If This Is a Man by Primo Levi and Night by Elie Wiesel. But immutable truth is hard. You might not want it on your bedside table. So, instead, there’s a tendency to vagary and whimsy; to mythology and to distance; to being unable to conceal your greater interest in Nazis than your interest in their victims (and Boyne cannot); to reading Anne Frank’s diary, a book about the Holocaust that omits the Holocaust; to this.</p><p>The sequel has Boyne’s skill and immorality: but this time, less of the first, and more of the second. It has, in parts, the tone of a serious, literary novel and a calm and self-aware narrator in Gretel, a woman with all Boyne’s careful words at her disposal, living in a sumptuous flat in Mayfair, of all places. Gretel is Bruno’s older sister, now in her 90s, ruminating on a lifetime of concealment and tidal guilt.</p><p>This is the valuable part of the novel: in Paris, in hiding, Gretel and her mother, an unrepentant Nazi, are shaved at a kangaroo court; she is attracted to violent sex with men who hate her because she is German; in Australia, she meets the psychopath she loved as a child, her father’s assistant, and they discuss their complicity; she becomes pregnant by a Jewish man.</p><p>I don’t doubt there is a valuable novel to be written about Nazi children, but Boyne does not choose this path. He lingers for a while, but then transforms his novel, instead, into what feels like a police procedural: a thriller.</p><p>In time, Gretel realises that the man in the flat below is torturing his wife and nine-year-old son, who is the same age as Bruno and Shmuel were when they died: what then will she do? Will she find the moral courage she lacked in Out-With? And did Bruno’s death – gasp for the fourth act bump! – have something to do with her? This sentimental sub-plot throws Boyne’s serious intentions to the wind, by offering something that should be nowhere near this subject: the comforting fantasy that there is justice in this world. The parallel narratives – one promising, one insulting – combine into a pulpy denouement that shames the author and the reader both.</p><p>All the Broken Places is published by Doubleday at £20.
